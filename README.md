# House-Price-Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for building a simple house price prediction model using Linear Regression. Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict numerical values, making it suitable for predicting house prices based on various features.

Overview
Predicting house prices is a common and important task in the real estate industry, as well as in data science. This project demonstrates how to use Linear Regression to create a basic house price prediction model. The model will predict house prices based on input features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is crucial. You can choose to use publicly available datasets like the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle or create your custom dataset by collecting data from various sources.

Ensure that your dataset includes features such as:

Number of bedrooms,
Square footage,
Number of bathrooms,
Location (latitude and longitude),
Age of the house,
Any additional relevant features.
